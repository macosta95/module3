<h1> <b>How do dogs learn? </b></h1>

<h2>Remember, dog training is as easy as A + B = C
or
Antecedent + Behavior = Consequence.</h2>

<h3>The term learning theory sounds more intimidating than it actually is. Simply put, dogs learn through association. So as pet parents, our goal is to teach our canine companions to associate words or cues with behaviors.</h3>

<h4> <em> <i>There are two main ways associations happen: classical and operant conditioning.</i> </em> </h4>

<p style="color:red;"> Classical conditioning occurs when a dog involuntarily associates two stimuli with each other. Consider this scenario: dogs salivate when they smell food. So if we repeatedly ring a bell right before a dog smells food, it will soon associate the sound of a ringing bell with food and begin to salivate, involuntarily. The word classical refers to the fact that, in this environment, learning is involuntary. The word conditioning refers to the process of teaching through association</p>

<p style="color:red;">Operant conditioning is just the opposite, when a dog learns to associate a voluntary behavior with a consequence. Now, the word consequence does not always refer to a negative repercussion. On the contrary, consequences are often desirable things in operant conditioning. In the earlier example, we learned that dogs can be conditioned to associate and anticipate food with the sound of a ringing bell, which causes them to salivate.</p>

<h1> <b>What's the Difference Between Wet and Dry Dog Food?</b> </h1>

<h2>Both dry dog food and wet dog food can provide nutritionally balanced diets, but the major difference is in the way they are processed.</h2>

<p style="color:blue;"> Wet food starts with grinding the protein sources, or meat ingredients. Then a gravy that contains vitamins, minerals, and grains is added. Once those are mixed, the food is cooked and sterilized to produce the canned product.

As a result, wet food has a much higher moisture content than dry food. You can see the percentage of maximum moisture on the label, under the Guaranteed Analysis section. A dry food might have around 10% moisture (max.) while a wet food might have something like 78% moisture (max.)</p>

<p style="color:blue;"> Dry food contains very similar ingredients, but instead of adding gravy and canning the product, the meat mixture is pulverized in order to create a consistent dough that can be cooked.

Once cooked, the dough is extruded through specifically shaped holes to form kibble. The kibble undergoes a drying process, and then is sprayed with fats, oils, vitamins, and minerals and packaged before the fats and oils can spoil.

Some dry dog food diets also add live probiotics to aid in digestive and immune health.</p>

<h1> <b>How to Introduce Dogs the Right Way</b></h1>

<h2>Steps for Introducing a New Dog to Your Current Dog </h2>
	
<h3>Find a Neutral Spot to Make Introductions</h3>	
	
<p style="color:lightgrey;"> If possible, find a neutral, outdoor, fully fenced space—an area that neither dog has “claimed” through frequent visits or walks. The space should be quiet with no other dogs or people, like the backyard of a friend who doesn’t have pets or a park during off hours when no one is there.

Unfortunately, this isn’t always possible, so the next best option is an outdoor space with enough room for the dogs to roam on-leash as they get to know one another. If outdoor space isn’t available, opt for a large garage or basement.</p>
